Changes:

- created a separate .css file for reset
- implemented reset to wipe any browser-default stylings
- created, added, and linked icon for page tab
- changed page title
- cleaned up css page by comma-separating elements that had the same styles
(IE- .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing)
- Changed <div> tags in header for buttons to <nav> tags to be more semantically specific. Made appropriate changes
to these same elements in the style.css file to support this change.
