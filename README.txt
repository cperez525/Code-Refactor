Changes:

- CSS: Created a separate .css file for reset

- HTML: Implemented reset to wipe any browser-default stylings

- HTML: Created, added, and linked icon for page tab

- HTML: Changed page title

- CSS: Cleaned up css page by comma-separating elements that had the same styles
(IE- .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing)

- HTML/CSS: Changed <div> tags in header for buttons to <nav> tags to be more semantically specific and accessible.
Made appropriate changes to these same elements in the style.css file to support this change.

- HTML: Added ID of same name to "search-engine-optimization" class div in html to enable button Search Engine Optimization
button to work as the other two header buttons do.

- HTML/CSS: Added several comments to clarify what several blocks of code were referring to.

- HTML: Changed "hero" class <div> tags to <img> tag to be semantically and accessible. Did not
appear to affect image.

- HTML: Changed <div> tags for content class to <article> (still questioning this one) and Search Engine Optimization, Online 
Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing <div> tags to <section> tags to be more semantically specific and accessible.

- HTML: Changed <div> tags for benefits class to <aside> (also questioning) and benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost class
<div> tags to <section> to be more semantically specific and accessible.

- HTML: Changed <div> tags for footer class to <footer> tags to be more semantically specific and accessible.

- HTML: Added additional spacing (perhaps too much?) to make the read of this code easier.

- HTML: Added alt text to images to increase accessibility.

- HTML/CSS: Because alts cannot be added to background images, I transitioned the background image for the hero class to a src image
referenced in the html, and removed/modified the CSS so that the image dimensions would not be changed. Added an alt to the hero
image to improve accessibility.
